/*
 * Topic: Pass by Value
 *
 * When a variable is passed by value to a function, a **copy** is made.
 * Changes made inside the function do **not** affect the original variable.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Used when:
 * - You donâ€™t want the original data modified.
 * - The data type is small (like int, float).
 *
 * Interview Tip:
 * Value passing is safe, but inefficient for large objects (like vectors or structs).
